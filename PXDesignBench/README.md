# PXDesignBench: A Unified Evaluation Suite for Protein Design

This repository provides a comprehensive suite of tools for protein design evaluation, integrating multiple state-of-the-art models with standardized pipelines. It supports both monomer and binder design, enabling thorough assessment across diverse aspects of protein design.


## 📂 Repository Structure

The codebase is organized into three main components:

- `metrics`: Scripts for evaluating multiple aspects of protein design, including sequence quality, structure quality, and designability.

- `tasks`: Pipelines for executing specific protein design evaluations (e.g., monomer, binder).

- `tools`: Wrappers for external models (e.g., Protenix, ProteinMPNN, AlphaFold2, ESMFold) to streamline integration.

### Supported Tasks & Tools
| **Task**   | **Sequence Generation** | **Structure Consistency**             |

## 📥 Download Required Model Weights (**Required**)

PXDesignBench relies on several external pretrained models (e.g., AF2, ProteinMPNN, etc.) for evaluation.  
These **weights are not bundled with the Python package and must be downloaded manually**.

After installing PXDesignBench, run:

```bash
bash download_tool_weights.sh
```

This script will automatically download and organize all required pretrained weights for:

- AlphaFold2
- ESMFold
- ProteinMPNN

Model weights for external tools are expected to be organized in a directory as follows:
```
├── af2
│   ├── LICENSE
│   ├── params_model_{1..5}.npz
│   ├── params_model_{1..5}_ptm.npz
│   ├── params_model_{1..5}_multimer_v3.npz
│
├── esmfold
│   ├── config.json
│   ├── pytorch_model.bin
│   ├── special_tokens_map.json
│   ├── tokenizer_config.json
│   └── vocab.txt
│
├── mpnn
│   ├── ca_model_weights/...
│   ├── soluble_model_weights/...
│   └── vanilla_model_weights/...
```
**Note:** Required Protenix files (weights, CCD files, etc.) will be auto-downloaded on the first evaluation run.

---
## 🚀 Running the Evaluation
We provide demo scripts for both monomer and binder design evaluation.
**Monomer evaluation example:**
```bash
bash monomer_eval_demo.sh
```

**Binder evaluation example:**
```bash
bash binder_eval_demo.sh
```

### Input Formats

PXDesignBench supports multiple input modes, allowing you to evaluate protein designs flexibly.  
The basic CLI arguments are:
- ``--data_dir``: Directory containing input structures.
- ``--dump_dir``: Output directory for evaluation results.
- ``--is_mmcif``: Flag indicating whether input files are in **mmCIF** format (otherwise assumed **PDB**).

**JSON-based Input**
One can also provide a JSON configuration file describing the evaluation task. This format allows fine-grained control over task parameters and is particularly useful for batch evaluation.

Example JSON:
```python
{
    "task": ...,          # "monomer" or "binder"
    "pdb_dir": ...,       # directory containing the input PDB structures
    "name": ...,          # name of the task; used to locate "{pdb_dir}/{pdb_name}.pdb"
    "pdb_names": ...,     # list of PDB file names to evaluate 
    "cond_chains": ...,   # list of condition chains (only for binder evaluation)
    "binder_chains": ..., # list of binder chains (binder evaluation only; currently supports **one** binder chain)
    "out_dir": ...        # directory to store evaluation results
}
```
Key points:

- Binder tasks require `binder_chains` to be explicitly specified.
- Currently only one binder chain is supported; all other chains will be treated as condition chains.
- `pdb_names` defines the exact structures to evaluate. If omitted, all files in `pdb_dir` with valid suffixes will be evaluated.

**Directory-based Input**
Instead of JSON, one may provide a directory path directly to `--data_dir`.
In this case:

- If `file_name_list` is provided, only matching files will be evaluated.
- Otherwise, all files in the directory with valid extensions will be included.


### Binder Evaluation with Additional Metadata

Binder evaluation supports passing a JSON file to specify additional metadata beyond the default inputs.  
This is useful for advanced scenarios such as:

1. **Evaluating cropped sequences**  
   - If the sequence to be evaluated is a cropped segment of an original sequence, you can provide the **full original sequence** along with a `crop` field to specify the range used in evaluation.  
   - The crop range can be multiple ranges such as `"1-120,130-150"` (comma-separated ranges, 1-based indexing, inclusive).

2. **Providing precomputed MSA for Protenix filter**  
   - The Protenix filter requires the target chain's MSA.  
   - By default, the evaluation script will automatically call the Protenix MSA server to compute the MSA.  
   - If you have already computed the MSA locally, you can skip the server call by specifying the `msa` field with:
     - `precomputed_msa_dir`: Path to the local MSA directory.
     - `pairing_db`: `uniref100`.

**Example JSON input:**
```json
[
    {
        "proteinChain": {
            "sequence": "NAFTVTVPKDLYVVEYGSNMTIECKFPVEKQLDLAALIVYWEMEDKNIIQFVHGEEDLKVQHSSYRQRARLLKDQLSLGNAALQITDVKLQDAGVYRCMISYGGADYKRITVKVNA",
            "label_asym_id": ["A0"],
            "use_msa": true,
            "msa": {
                "precomputed_msa_dir": "examples/msa/PDL1/0",
                "pairing_db": "uniref100"
            },
            "crop": "1-116"
        }
    }
]
```

### Multi-GPU / Distributed Evaluation
PXDesignBench exposes device IDs for each integrated model, enabling:
- Deployment across multiple GPUs for **parallel evaluation**.
- Integration into **DDP (Distributed Data Parallel)** training pipelines for **online evaluation tracking**.

For example, the following is a pseudocode snippet illustrating online evaluation tracking in the DDP model training pipeline:
```python
from pxdbench.run import run_task
from protenix.utils.distributed import DIST_WRAPPER

@torch.no_grad()
def _evaluate_design(self):
    # Sampling stage
    self._inference_design()
    DIST_WRAPPER.barrier()

    # Load task list
    with open(self._get_eval_json_path(), "r") as f:
        all_eval_tasks = json.load(f)

    # Distribute tasks among workers
    task_indices = list(range(len(all_eval_tasks)))[DIST_WRAPPER.rank::DIST_WRAPPER.world_size]
    if not task_indices:
        self.local_print("No task to evaluate, skipping.")
        results = []
    else:
        self.local_print(f"Running {len(task_indices)} tasks...")
        results = [
            run_task(all_eval_tasks[i], self.configs.eval, device_id=DIST_WRAPPER.local_rank)
            for i in task_indices
        ]

    # Gather results
    all_eval_results = DIST_WRAPPER.all_gather_object(results)
    # Custom logging...
```

### Evaluation Process

- If `use_gt_seq=True`, the sequence from the input structure is used directly.
- If `use_gt_seq=False`, the tool will first run the assigned sequence generation model (e.g., ProteinMPNN) to generate sequences.
- Structure quality is then assessed using the corresponding structure prediction models:
  - Monomer → ESMFold
  - Binder → AlphaFold2 / Protenix
- Metrics include:
  - Self-consistency between predicted structures
  - Confidence scores from structure predictors (e.g., pLDDT, ipTM)
  - Shape-based metrics, e.g. secondary structure content (α-helix, β-sheet, loop ratios), radius of gyration, etc.
- Results are stored in a summary CSV for downstream analysis.

### Post-processing
PXDesignBench provides scripts for analyzing the **diversity** and **novelty** of generated protein structures.
To enable Foldseek-based diversity and novelty calculations, you must first install **Foldseek**, a structural alignment and similarity search tool.  
Foldseek is **not** bundled with PXDesignBench and must be installed separately.  
Please follow the official guide here: [Foldseek Installation](https://github.com/steineggerlab/foldseek#installation).

**Examples:**

- **Monomer post-processing**
```bash
python3 pxdbench/scripts/postprocess_monomer.py --input_dir examples/monomer
```
- **Binder post-processing**
```bash
python3 pxdbench/scripts/postprocess_binder.py --input_dir examples/binder --is_mmcif true
```
